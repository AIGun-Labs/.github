AIGun is the world's first AI exchange.

## Overview

AIGun is an innovative AI-driven platform designed to revolutionize how users interact with financial markets. By leveraging advanced AI agents, AIGun continuously monitors real-time market information, including news feeds and social media (e.g., Twitter), to identify potential investment opportunities. Our intelligent system analyzes this data, extracts relevant assets, and presents actionable insights to users, empowering them to make informed trading decisions.
